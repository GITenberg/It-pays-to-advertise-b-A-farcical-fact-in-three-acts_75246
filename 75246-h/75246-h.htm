necessary. Down left is an oak typewriting
table with a typewriter on it. It is obviously
out of place in the room, and is evidently only
a temporary arrangement. Handsome walnut
furniture. Mantel set on mantel. Fire dogs
and irons in fireplace. All-over carpet. Handsome
busts on bookcases. Chandelier and four
brackets. Curtains on windows at back. It is
seven o’clock in the evening—early September.</i></p>

Johnson? Has young Mr. Martin come in yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> No, Miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But I told you not to interrupt me until
he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> I know, Miss, but it’s that Mr. Ambrose
Peale again; he’s called four times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Say that Mr. Martin will be back at eight
o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Yes, Miss. There’s a lady waiting,
too, Miss, to see Mr. Martin Senior. Here’s her
card.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Mme. la Comtesse de Beaurien. Tell her
that Mr. Martin Senior can see no one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> I can’t make her comprehend anything
I say. She just sits and waits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, bring her in, then. I’ll make her understand
somehow, but, Johnson, don’t fail to let me
know the minute young Mr. Martin gets home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> (<i>Advancing to her</i>) Mam’selle

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, no, I’m Miss Grayson, Mr. Martin’s
secretary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> (<i>Blankly</i>) Sec-ree-taree?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I’m sorry, but it’s quite impossible for
you to see Mr. Martin. He is confined to the house
with a severe attack of gout. If you will write him
I will see that he gets your letter. You can address
him here instead of the office; while he is ill I come
here every day for the mail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Pardon, mais je ne comprends pas—je

ill....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Je répète que je ne parle pas anglais.
Mr. Martin est-il ici?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It’s quite useless for you to talk: I don’t
understand French.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Un moment, Mam’selle—peut-être je
parle trop vite.... (<i>More slowly</i>) Je désire
parler à M. Martin àpropos des affaires. Je suis
riche. Mais on peut toujours être plus riche. Si je
pouvais obtenir l’agence du savon Martin pour la
France ça serait une belle affaire. Je donnerais
cinquante mille francs pour cette agence. Répéter
cela à M. Martin et je suis sûre qu’il me recevra immédiatement.
Vous comprenez maintenant——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But I really don’t understand French.

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What a surprise! (<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> goes and

what are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Coming to her and facing her over

you marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Why, really——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You love me, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I—I don’t know what to say——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Say Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Shyly</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Trying to grab her</i>) You angel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Eluding him</i>) Wait!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We’ll be married right away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But suppose your father disapproves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> He won’t know anything about it until
we’re married, and then what could he do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> He might cut you off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Would you care?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Hastily</i>) I? No, no, indeed. I was
thinking of you, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Don’t you bother about me. We’ll be
married to-morrow, and then come home for the
parental blessing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, I couldn’t do that. It wouldn’t be
square. I’m his private secretary: he trusts me.
To bring me here to his home and then to find I’d
married his son on the sly—we couldn’t do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You do make it sound rather bad. I
wouldn’t want us to give father the worst of it;
we’ve always been pretty good friends, he and I. I
guess I’d better tell him—in a week or so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Why, Rodney, if you love me, we must
get this awful suspense over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But suppose he does object?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Even then I wouldn’t give you up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Mary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You could go into business, make a big
man of yourself, make me proud of you——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You talk just like the heroine in a play
I saw last night. She wanted the hero to go to
work, and he did, and then for four acts everybody
suffered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Don’t you want to work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Seriously</i>) I should say not. Imagine
going to bed every night, knowing you’ve got
to get up in the morning and go to business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You’d be happier, wouldn’t you, if you
had a job?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Please don’t talk like father; he’s
preached a job at me ever since I left college.
Why should I work? Father made millions out of
soap and is forever complaining that he’s always
had his nose to the grindstone, that he’s worked
fourteen hours a day for thirty years, that he’s never
known what fun was, that it’s all made him old before
his time. I can’t see the sense of following an
example like that—I really can’t. He’s got enough
for you, and me, and our children. Yes, and our
children’s grandchildren. I’ve explained all this to
him but I can’t seem to make him understand. But
it’s simple: why work when there’s millions in the
family? And why even talk of money when you
and I are in love? Come, kiss me. (<i>He leans towards

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No, you mustn’t—not till you’ve spoken
to your father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You won’t kiss me till I tell him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And you will when I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes.</p>

your allowance again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Innocently</i>) What it simply proves

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And if my allowance is too small for
one, it’s much too small for two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Father, has it ever occurred to you that
I might marry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Of course it has! You’re fool enough
for anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I don’t consider a man a fool because
he’s married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> That’s because you’ve never tried it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Nervously</i>) The girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes, girl—you’re not going to marry
an automobile or a polo pony—you’re going to
marry a girl, aren’t you? Some blue-eyed, doll-faced,

doesn’t God give young men some sense about
women?</p>

any such absurd, ridiculous marriage! Thank
Heaven, you had sense enough not to elope——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I wanted to, but she wouldn’t. She insisted
on your being told, so you see what an injustice——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Injustice? Can’t you see that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
wished me to know, so that if I disapproved and cut
you off, she’d not be stuck with <i>you</i> on her hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Please, father—it’s quite useless. (<i>He

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> No, my boy, wait a minute. Remember,
I’m your friend even if I am your father.

you, he doesn’t get one penny of my money,

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What can you do? You’re not a producer—you
never will be. (<i>Crosses to <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) You’re

He did it all——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, Rodney——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You were bully the way you stuck up

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Genuinely</i>) Please don’t, Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Just because he’s got a lot of money he
seems to think there isn’t any left, but I’ll show him.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Of course I am. When I break our engagement
he may feel sort of lonely for a while

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I sort of begin to wish this marriage

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It wouldn’t work out. I’m a business
woman. Even if your son did love me—really love—I
wouldn’t marry him. Just now he’s twenty-four
with an India-rubber heart that is easy to stretch
and easier to snap back. All boys at twenty-four
are like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Reminiscently</i>) I guess so. I remember

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I don’t know yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Do you think he’ll make good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> He will if he keeps at it. (<i>Rises and

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, you’ll keep him at it? (<i>Rises
and goes <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> That wasn’t our agreement. I only undertook
to get him to start to work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Hum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Isn’t that true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Quite—quite. I was just thinking we
might make some new agreement to have you keep
him on the job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Rubbing her fingers as if handling
money</i>) I’m a business woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What strikes you as fair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I’d rather the proposition came from
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What do you say to your present salary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and at the end of the year I will personally
give you a check for twenty-five per cent of what
Rodney has made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, that wouldn’t interest me at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What’s your proposition, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Promptly</i>) My present salary doubled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Um—that’s pretty steep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You told me what I’d done <i>already</i> was
worth $50,000 to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Merely a figure of speech, my dear.
Let’s see, you’re getting $40 a week, and....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> $50, and I want $100.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Sounds like a hold-up. (<i>Crosses <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Then let’s drop it. This new contract
was your idea, not mine. Good-evening. (<i>She
starts to go, gets to door, which she bangs as if
she had gone. She remains however in the room</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Hold on—hold on—(<i>He turns and
sees her, and then chuckles at her joke on him. She
laughs, too</i>) I was simply figuring. Tell you what
I’ll do: $75 a week and 10 per cent of what Rodney
makes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Seventy-five a week and 10 per cent of
what he makes? All right, I’ll go you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Goes to desk, takes note-book</i>) Will
you just write me a note stating the facts and the
consideration?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You want it in writing? (<i>Crosses to
table <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> and sits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Certainly, it’s always safer that way.
(<i>He writes. As he writes</i>) As soon as you see
Rodney, you’ll have to discharge me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I will, violently. I make a pretty good
actor under your direction. How did you like
that irate father stuff?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Great! You needn’t make the note long.
Just a memorandum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Holding up paper</i>) How’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Reading</i>) I think that covers it—if
you’ll sign it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Confused</i>) Didn’t I sign it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Smiling</i>) No, and never put off till
to-morrow what you can sign to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Signing</i>) There you are. (<i>Hands
<span class="smcap">Mary</span> paper</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Sits on table</i>) Thanks. Now, Mr.
Martin, there’s just one question I’d like to ask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Go ahead, I’ll answer you anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Why is it, when Rodney’s been out of
college for <i>two</i> years, that it’s only the last three
months you’ve been so persistent about getting him
to work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> It’s like this. You know old John
Clark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> The man you dine with so often?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes, friends and rivals for thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> He’s in Ivory Soap, isn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Emphatically</i>) I should say he is—one
of the big men there. We’ve fought all our
lives over soap, but he’s never been able to lick me,
and—well, I haven’t been able to lick him, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Perhaps that’s why you’re such good
friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Perhaps it is. Anyhow, as it’s fifty-fifty
in business, we’ve lately narrowed the fight
down to a family matter. You know old John Clark
has a son, too: Ellery—nasty, egotistical, self-satisfied
young puppy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I know, I’ve talked to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, old Clark thinks Ellery is the
prince of all modern business, and he kept pitying
me so much about Rodney’s being an idler—a rich
man’s son—it got on my nerves, so lately I made
a bet with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> A bet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I bet him thirty thousand dollars my
son could make more in a year than his son could.
So I had to get Rodney busy, and he’s got to make
good. He can’t be such a pin-head as he looks! If
there’s anything in heredity there must be something
of me in him, and we’ve got to find it—we’ve
got to develop Rodney, dig deep, maybe blast. If
he doesn’t win out——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But he will, I’m sure he will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> It isn’t just the money. I guess I’m a
sentimental old fool, but I’m proud. I want my boy
to be Rodney Martin, not just Cyrus Martin’s son,
and I want to show old Clark that as a judge of
character he’s a bigger fool than I am. If I don’t
get that bet——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But you’re going to, I’m sure you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> By George, Miss Grayson, if I weren’t
a bit old and on the shelf, I’d marry you myself.
You and I could clean up all the loose change in
America. (<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> enters <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Martin</span>, seeing him,
changes his whole attitude. Rises</i>) I don’t care to
discuss the matter further, Miss Grayson: consider
yourself discharged. Good evening. (<i>Crosses to
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s all right, Mary. You can have a
job in my office. (<i>Crosses to <span class="allsmcap">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Scornfully</i>) Your office, ha! (<i>Suddenly</i>)
Oh, my foot, my poor foot! (<i>He limps
painfully towards door</i>) Your office! It’s a joke,
young man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, you needn’t laugh! I’ll show you.
(<i>Crosses <span class="allsmcap">L. C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Winking at <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>) Silence, you
young puppy. Oh, my poor foot! (<i>He exits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, Rodney! (<i>Sits on sofa</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Gout’s an awful thing, isn’t it? (<i>Sits
on sofa</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, Rodney, I’m afraid I’ve spoiled everything
for you—your future——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Nonsense, you’ve made my future.
Without you, I’d never have got the idea, the big
idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Idea for what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> The idea to make money out of; that’s
all you need. And, just think, I found it in this
book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What idea? What book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s a cook-book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What on earth——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Well, you see, when I was packing I
stumbled across this book; it fell open at this page—fate
was on the job—it was a hunch. Look!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Looking</i>) But what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s an old family recipe for making
cheap soap. It says it’s the cheapest soap in the
world. Cheaper even than the manufacturers make
it. I’m going into the soap business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Amazed</i>) What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Sure. Father did; look at the money
he made. Why shouldn’t I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Rises, goes <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) You’re joking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’m in dead earnest. I’m going to
buck the trust. (<i>Rises</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But how can you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I don’t know, but I will. You see, I’ll
have all the popular sympathy: independent young
son of soap-king fights father; don’t buy from the
trust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But is that very nice to your <i>father</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Has he been nice to me? It’s great!
Down with monopoly! Hurrah for the people!
I’ve heard political speeches like that. Hurrah for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the people’s soap! That isn’t a bad name, either.
The People’s Soap. (<i>Lays book on table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But you haven’t any capital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Dejected</i>) I never thought of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You’d need a lot of money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Bracing up</i>) Well, I’ll just have to
get it, that’s all, and you’ll be my secretary. Of
course, till I make big money I wouldn’t ordinarily
have thought of taking you away from father—but
as long as he discharged you—well, you
work for me now. What does father pay you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Fifty dollars a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’ll pay you a hundred and fifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But you haven’t any money.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Johnson</span> enters from door upper <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Beg pardon, Mr. Rodney, but Mr.

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> For the fifth time——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Puzzled</i>) Ambrose Peale? Oh, yes,

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Yes, sir. (<i>He exits door upper <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> He’s got something to do with the
theater. When I was in Harvard two years ago I
met him one night in the lobby of the theater. I
haven’t seen him since—it was the night we had our
egg fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You and Mr. Peale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, no, the fellows threw eggs at the
people on the stage. You see, it was a college
play——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Did you throw eggs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I forgot to bring any. Peale was the
manager of the show and was mighty decent to me—kept
me out of jail.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Peale</span> enters from door upper <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, well, Rodney Martin, how are
you? (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>) How are you, dear lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> How do you do? Miss Grayson—Mr.
Ambrose Peale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Ambrose Peale—that’s me absolutely.
Well, I’m still in the show business. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>)
Ever see “The Belle of Broadway”? Great show,
great girls, great cast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, are you an actor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Scornfully</i>) An actor? I should say
not. I’m a press-agent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> But, say, be sure to catch that show;
it may leave the city soon—out-of-town bookings,
you know—but remember the name: “The Belle
of Broadway.” And now if you’ll excuse me, Miss,
I came to talk business with Mr. Martin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Business? Surely—surely. (<i>Winking
at <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>) I’m a business man—now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I’ll be back in a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Thank you, Miss Grayson. (<i>She exits
door lower <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Now, I’m not much on handing myself
flowers across the footlights, but do you happen to
remember what I did for you the night of the egg
fight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You fixed things with the chief of
police and kept me from being expelled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> By George, you do remember. And you
said any time you could do anything for me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> That’s still true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You’re immense, son. Now, it’s this
way—have a chair. (<i>He sits. <span class="smcap">Rodney</span> does likewise</i>)
Between you and me, “The Belle of Broadway”
is an awful thing—business gone to pot.
Something’s got to be done. Some great stuff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
pulled off to give it a boost, and that’s where you
come in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You’ve got an aeroplane, haven’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes, but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Then everything’s all right. Now you
abduct the leading lady, Julia Clark, to-morrow
night, in your aeroplane—elope with her——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Sure—some stunt, too—never been done.
Julia’ll stand for it—she’s game for any press
gag——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But I couldn’t do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Certainly you can. I’m telling you
Julia’ll stand for it—a bird of a story—no performance.
Why? You’re up in the air with the leading
lady. The next night standing room only to catch
a look at the girl you’re stuck on. I can see the
headlines now: Soap King’s Son Takes New Star
Among the Stars—with flashlights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But it’s out of the question. (<i>Rises,
takes chair to table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> What’s the matter with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I wouldn’t do it, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Gee, that’s tough!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’m not backing down—anything in
reason, but you see, there’s someone who might object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> A girl? (<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> nods</i>) Her? (<i>Pointing
to where <span class="smcap">Mary</span> exited</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Rises and puts chair back</i>) I guess it’s
cold: girls are funny about their beaux doing a
little innocent thing like eloping with some other
girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Why don’t you try somebody else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I have! You were my last card. Well,
I’m fired!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Fired?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Sure, that stunt would have kept us going,
but now, on the level—well, the show’s so bad,
people won’t even go see it on a pass. We’ll close
Saturday and I’m out——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> A fake story like that would really
have helped?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Helped a whole lot: given us a fresh
start, and then I’d have pulled off some new stunts
and saved my job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, nonsense. If that were true, I’d
feel mighty uncomfortable at not being able to
oblige you, but an obvious trumped-up lie like that
can’t be any good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> It can’t, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, I know it’s advertising——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You bet it’s advertising. What made
Anna Held? Milk baths. What made Gaby Deslys?
A dago king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But that kind of advertising can’t be
of real value. (<i>Sits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, you’re one of those guys who don’t
believe in advertising, are you? Now, don’t get me
talking advertising. That’s where I live, where I
have my town house and country estate, my yacht
and motors. That’s my home. Maybe you think
love is important? Piffle. Advertising, my boy, the
power of suggestion, the psychology of print; say
a thing often enough and hard enough and the other
chap’ll not only believe you, he’ll think it’s his own
idea, and he’ll fight for it. Some old gink, a professor
of psychology, showed forty Vassar girls the
other day two samples of satin, one blue, one pink,
same grade, same value, same artistic worth. One
he described as a delicate warm old rose, the other
a faded blue. He asked them to choose their favorite.
Thirty-nine out of the forty picked the old
rose. Why? Because they’d been told it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
warm and delicate; no faded blue for theirs! What
did it? The power of suggestion—advertising!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Amused</i>) You seem to know something
about it——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I not only seem to, I do. You heard
me tell that girl of yours a few minutes ago that
“The Belle of Broadway” was the biggest hit in
town. Ask her to go to the theater. Give her
her choice and I’ll bet you four dollars to a fried
egg she picks “The Belle of Broadway.” Advertising!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I don’t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, try it—and say, what makes you
go to the theater yourself? I’ll tell you—it’s what
you’ve read about the play or what some fellows
told you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Beginning to be convinced</i>) Why, I
suppose that’s true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> And what he tells you, some other
guy has told him. Ninety-seven per cent of the
public believe what they’re told, and what they’re
told is what the other chap’s been told—and the fellow
who told him read it somewhere. When you
see a thing in print about something you don’t really
know anything about, you come pretty near believing
it. And all the advertiser has to do is to tell
you right and you’ll fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But I never read advertisements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, you don’t, eh? I guess you do. If I
say His Master’s Voice, you know that advertises a
phonograph. You’re on to what soap “It Floats”
refers to. There’s a Reason—Uneeda—Quaker
Oats—Phoebe Show—Children Cry For it—Sapolio—Grape
Nuts—Peruna—The Road of Anthracite—Spearmint—Pierce
Arrow—57 Varieties—Kodak—White
Seal—Gold Dust Twins—He Won’t Be
Happy Till He Gets It—Bull Durham—Pianola—Cuticura—Melachrino—Clysmic—Goodyear—Steinway—Thermos—Coca-Cola—The
Watch that
Made The Dollar Famous. I suppose you don’t
know what any of them mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Amused</i>) Why, I know what they all
mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You bet you do. What kind of garters
do you wear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Why, let me see: Boston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Exactly. What do you know about ’em?
Nothing. Are they any better than any other
garter? You don’t know—I don’t know—but all
my life, every magazine I’ve ever looked into has
had a picture of a man’s leg with a certain kind of
garter on it—Boston—so when I go into a store to
buy a pair of garters I just naturally say Boston;
so do you. What do you know about Mennen’s
Talcum Powder? Nothing, except that it has the
picture of the homeliest man in the world on the
box and it’s so impressed your imagination, you just
mechanically order Mennen’s. If I say to you, E.
&amp; W., you don’t think it’s a corset, do you? If I
say C. B., you don’t think it’s a collar, and what
about the well-known and justly famous B. V. D.’s?
You don’t read advertisement? Rot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> No ‘but’ about it: advertising’s responsible
for everything. When a department store advertises
a seven-dollar shirt-waist for four dollars,
you don’t believe it’s on the level, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Neither do I, but there’s a hell of a lot
of women who do. When Bryan advertised the
Grape Juice Highball, do you know that its sale
went up 652 gallons a day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> How do you know it was 652?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I’ll let you into a little secret: I don’t
know. I don’t know a damned thing about grape
juice, and as long as my health and strength keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
up, I hope I never will, but if I said I’d read in a
newspaper that the sale had gone up 652 gallons,
you wouldn’t have doubted it, would you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, I suppose I wouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> And you’d have told somebody else and
he’d have believed you, too. Say, do you drink
much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Can you tell the difference between a
vintage wine and last year’s champagne? Sure, you
can: it costs more. Son, the world is full of bunk.
Ninety-seven per cent of the people are sheep, and
you can get ’em all by advertising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You are gradually making me come to
the conclusion that you believe in publicity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Believe in it! It’s my life. What kind
of eggs do you eat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Why, hen’s eggs, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Why “of course”? Did you ever eat a
duck’s egg?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Why, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Do you know anything against the duck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Exactly. When a duck lays an egg it’s
a damn fool and keeps quiet about it, but when a
hen does, my boy—cluck-cluck all over the place!
She’s advertising. So you eat hen’s eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You’re beginning to convince me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> If I’m beginning to convince you, that’s
advertising, too. Say, are you for Roosevelt or
against him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’m for him strong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I’m against him. I read one paper, you
read another. I think he’s a faker, you think he’s a
great man. But does either of us really know anything
about him except what we’ve read? Have
you ever met Roosevelt or talked to him or known
anybody who did know him? I haven’t, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
point is, whatever we may think, good or bad,
we’ve heard a lot about him, because he’s the best
advertiser in the world. And that, my son, is the
whole secret of it: get ’em talking about you, get
’em praisin’ if you can, or get ’em cussin’, but for
the love of Heaven, don’t let ’em be quiet. Mention
your name—have ’em argue about you—boost or
knock—be a hero or a villain, but don’t be a dub.
Why, give me the money, a little time, a few pages
of advertising, and I can sell you shares in the
Atlantic Ocean!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Excited</i>) You really believe that
with proper advertising you could build up a great
business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Believe! Look around you: everything’s
doing it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And you are out of a job.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Unless you do the aero-elopement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) Then you’re out of it. Do
you want to work for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> When can you begin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What’s your salary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I’ve been getting $60, but I’m worth
$75.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’ll give you a hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> What is your business? Counterfeiting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, it’s——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Don’t tell me. As long as it don’t send
me to state’s prison or the chair, it’s all right.
Could I have about $25 advance on my salary now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Is that customary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> It is with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, all right. (<i>He gives him the
money</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Just as an evidence of good faith. (<i>He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
counts money</i>) Well, now I’m working for you,
what business are you in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> The soap business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Grinning</i>) Nice clean business. With
father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Against him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> My father and I have had a quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I know, I know: fathers are very unreasonable
these days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’m going to fight the soap trust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, you’re no piker. You’ve picked
out a nice refined job. How long have you been
at it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Twenty minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> How’s it going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Fine, since I got an idea from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> They grow all over me—help yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’m going to get a factory, advertise
like the very dickens: Soap King’s son fights father—and
licks him, too, by George!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you
know why your father is the soap king?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I suppose because he controls all the
soap business in the country except Ivory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Exactly, and the way he keeps control
of it is by buying out all his live competitors. Now,
here’s a blue-ribbon champion of the world scheme.
Why don’t we make good and sell out to father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, I don’t care to do that. I want to
make good myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, if father is forced to buy you out,
isn’t that enough? What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’ve got to be a success on my own.
I’ve got to show father, and—Miss Grayson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Comprehending</i>) Oh! Making good
with the dame, eh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You see, father says I can’t earn five
dollars a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> He isn’t right, is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, sir, you’ll see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I hope so. Pretty tough if you couldn’t.
Some job trying to sell soap if father’s against us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I suppose it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I tell you: why not make such a hit
with the soap, advertise it so strong, he’ll just have
to back you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Now that’s settled, we’re going to lick
father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, that’s settled. What do I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You write the ads that make us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> It’s my chance. Think, I’ll never have
to see “The Belle of Broadway” again! I’ll write
ads, I’ll conduct a campaign that’ll keep your father
awake, and in three months at the most he’ll be begging
for a chance to back us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I believe we’ll do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Come on, come on. Let’s get busy.
What’s the name of the soap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It hasn’t been named.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, what is there about it that makes
it different from any other soap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, what could there be about some
soap that was different from some other soap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Well, let’s see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Where did you get it from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> From this cook-book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Are you kidding me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No. Half an hour ago I decided to go
in to business, and I happened to find this recipe for
soap in a cook-book—it’s the cheapest soap in the
world. (<i>Reflecting</i>) That’s not a bad title: the
cheapest soap in the world. (<i>A pause. They reflect</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You’re wrong, son. There’s an awful
bunch of people that buy a lot of expensive stuff,
not because it’s better, but because it costs more—and
the poor nuts think it ought to be better—so can
that cheap stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Well, how about The Most Expensive
Soap in the World?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> My boy, I could kiss you. A pupil after
my own heart—fifty cents a cake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> A dollar, and we’ll make it a warm delicate
old rose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Each cake in a separate box with a paper
rose on the lid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> But what’ll we call it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Old Rose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Rotten—doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Let’s think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I am thinking. I never stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> The Soap that Made Pittsburg Clean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Too long, and no good anyway, because
Pittsburg isn’t clean. You need something catchy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I had an idea a while ago: The People’s
Soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Not if you’re going to catch the rich
boobs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> That’s true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> We need something that’s universally appealing.
What is it? What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Looking off-stage toward where <span class="smcap">Mary</span>
went</i>) Love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Slush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Suddenly</i>) I’ve got it: Superstition—everybody’s
superstitious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Rot! I’m not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I say, there’s a bit of luck for us right at
the start—a pin with the head toward you. (<i><span class="smcap">Rodney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></span>
stoops to pick it up</i>) See, you were going to
pick it up! Everybody is superstitious. Oh, they
say they’re not, just as you did, but did you ever
meet a guy who, if he didn’t mind walking under a
ladder, didn’t hate to spill salt, or else he wanted
to see the moon over his right shoulder—or he picked
up pins, or carried a lucky coin, wouldn’t do things
on Friday? Why, the whole world’s superstitious.
Get something on that and you hit everybody. I’ve
got eighty-six horseshoes home myself. I never
saw a gink that would sit thirteen at table. We’re
all crazy. (<i>They pause and think. They both sit
on end of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Could we—?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No. (<i>They pause</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Suppose we—?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> No—(<i>Pause</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Wait! Wait—listen! The Thirteen
Soap—Unlucky for Dirt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Coming over and kissing <span class="smcap">Rodney</span> on
the brow</i>) Son, it’s all over: the old man’ll be on
his knees in a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We open the office Monday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Where’s the office?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Let’s get one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> With furniture and everything. Say—(<i><span class="smcap">Mary</span>
enters from door lower <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> Seeing her</i>)
There’s the dame; ask her to go to the theater, just
to prove what I say. See for yourself. (<i>He goes
up-stage</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Turning to her</i>) Oh, Mary, to celebrate,
let’s go to the theater to-morrow night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I’d love to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What do you want to see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I hear “The Belle of Broadway” is very
good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Peale</span> yawns and stretches out his arms complacently.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) I guess I don’t know
about advertising, eh? (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>) My last official
act is giving you a box for to-morrow night.
(<i>He writes</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, yes, you’re with that play, aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I am. (<i>Handing her pass</i>) Er—I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But isn’t it an imposition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Not on us, it isn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Thank you. (<i>Crosses to <span class="smcap">Rodney</span>. To
<span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) I didn’t mean to bother you, but I’m so
interested: I thought, regarding Mr. Peale’s business,
I’d like to hear——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s all settled, Mary. Mr. Peale, my
general manager. Mr. Peale, my secretary. Mary,
here it is: The Thirteen Soap—Unlucky for Dirt:
The Most Expensive Soap in the World.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Genuinely</i>) Why, that’s perfectly wonderful—who
thought of it? (<i>Looking at <span class="smcap">Peale</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Turning to him</i>) You did, really?
Why, you’re splendid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Youth, brains, efficiency—that’s our
motto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We’ll make a hundred thousand dollars
the first year—sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Reflectively</i>) And ten per cent of that
is——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Oh nothing, nothing—I was
just figuring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We’re going to make our soap famous
by advertising, and then force father to back us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> That sounds bully, and at the start you
won’t need much capital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Capital?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> With fifty thousand dollars I can make
the Great American People have hysterics for the
Thirteen Soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Fifty thousand dollars, and I’ve got
only a thousand. Oh! (<i>Sits on chair <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> of desk</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh! (<i>Sitting on sofa</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Sitting in arm-chair <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> of table</i>) But
can’t you raise it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Peale</span></i>) How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Don’t ask me. Raising money is the
only thing I never got on to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Peale, you’re fired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, it was a good job while it lasted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) Gimme back that $25.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Rises, take out money and returns it
to <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) Good-bye, old pal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Rises, and comes down-stage between
<span class="smcap">Rodney</span> and <span class="smcap">Peale</span></i>) But couldn’t you start with
less?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Of course we could. Couldn’t we,
Peale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Not and do it right. No use wasting
money piking when you advertise. Splurge, my
lad, splurge or let it remain dormant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’ve got a thousand in the bank; the
aeroplane’s worth four—it cost eight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Then if you’re lucky it might sell for
two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> The motors ought to bring another
four. That’d be seven, isn’t that something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Seven thousand is not to be spoken of
venomously, but in advertising—well, going easy,
it might last you a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I have a——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Some money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We couldn’t take money from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No, I know a—a man that might put in
five thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> That’s twelve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Suddenly</i>) Does your father advertise
much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I don’t think so; does he, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Not very much: he’s conservative. He
doesn’t believe in reckless advertising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Nothing sensational or exciting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Why, he’s licked now, and I’ll tell you
why. We can advertise just for your father’s
benefit alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I don’t quite understand your plan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Why, plaster this neighborhood with
Thirteen Soap advertisements. Do the same around
your father’s office so that every time he went out
or came in he’d see Thirteen Soap. We could advertise
only in the newspapers he reads. We’d send
him circulars every mail. I could make a splurge
just for him that would look like we were giving up
$10,000 a day. Within a month he’d think that
Thirteen Soap was the only soap in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> How much would it take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Five thousand a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And you could land him in a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> My boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And we’ve got one thousand—all cash,
and eleven thousand in prospects. Go ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You mean I’m hired again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Sure you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Gimme back that $25.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Giving it back</i>) Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> The best thing you ever did was to engage
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Peale, we’ll be rich men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> With your money and my ideas, I’ll be a

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Comment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh.... Répétez ça s’il vous plait—pas
vite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Je suis madame la comtesse de Beaurien.
Je désire obtenir l’agence du Savon Martin
pour la France. Je peux donner cinquante mille
francs pour cette agence. Et enfin, voulez-vous
arranger cette affaire pour moi? Je suis riche, j’ai
beaucoup de recommendations—je suis bien connue
à Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Wait a minute. Wait a minute. (<i>To
<span class="smcap">Peale</span></i>) She wants the agency for father’s soap
for France and is willing to pay 50,000 francs for
the concession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> How much is that in money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Had I better tell your father? (<i>Goes
to door lower <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Inspired. Crosses to <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>) No,
no, why not keep father out of this? We’ll sell her
the agency for the Thirteen Soap—that’d be another
$10,000 for us. Peale, she’s a gift from the gods!
(<i>Goes to <span class="smcap">Countess</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> She is. Go to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But how can you sell her your agency?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I don’t know—how can I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> A pipe. Ask her if she’s superstitious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, if I only knew how to talk French!—Madame—êtes-vous
superstitious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I mean—superstitieuse? (<i><span class="smcap">Countess</span>
looks blank</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> She doesn’t get you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>He goes and takes the <span class="smcap">Countess’</span> parasol</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Pardon me.... (<i>Starts to raise it. With
a cry of protest: “Faites pas ça”, she stops him</i>)
She’s superstitious, all right—(<i>To her</i>) It ought to
be a pipe to land you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Listen: je suis le fils de Museer Martin—vous
savez?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> (<i>Delightedly</i>) Oui, oui.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Slowly</i>) Nous manfacturons, I mean

Treize—(<i>He holds up his fingers to indicate thirteen</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Oui, oui.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Impressed</i>) It must be great to have a
college education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Savon Treize—pas—bon—pour—what
the deuce is dirt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, yes—sal—pas bon pour sal——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) Savon Treize—pas bon

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Gleefully</i>) She likes it—she likes it.</p>

in which I am now interested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Nothing doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Gulping</i>) I thought I’d like to borrow

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Well, I thought as a friend of the

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> That’s all right—you needn’t go,

<p><span class="smcap">Smith.</span> Of course, you haven’t tried much. But
as you said, I am an old friend—and I figured if
you gave me your word that you’d return the
money within a year—perhaps after all it would
only be the act of an old friend to take a chance.
That’s what friends are for.</p>

it away from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes, sir, I’m going to manufacture the
Thirteen Soap: Unlucky for Dirt: The Most Expensive
Soap in the World! I’m going to break the
trust; I’m going to attack monopoly. I’m going to
appeal to the American people for fair play against
the soap trust. You’ve always wanted me to go into
business. Well, I’m in, and forgive me, father, but
I’m going to put you out of business. I’m going to
advertise all over the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You can’t fight the soap trust with
advertising: we’re established.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes, yes, we can: think what advertising
means: the power of suggestion—the psychology
of print. Why, 97 per cent of the public believe
what they’re told, and what they’re told is what
the other chaps have been told, and the fellow who
told him read it somewhere. Advertising is responsible
for everything. People are sheep, and advertising
is the way to make ’em follow your lead. (<i>He
is beginning to forget the speech</i>) Say, what makes
you go to the theater? (<i><span class="smcap">Peale</span> enters from door <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>

you. It’s what you’ve read of the play or what some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
fellows told you, and the fellow that told him, read
it—in a newspaper. (<i>Remembering—rapidly</i>) And
that, my boy, is the whole secret of it. You’ve got
to be talked about—get ’em praisin’ or cussin’, but
don’t let ’em be quiet. I want to tell you; what kind
of duck eggs do you eat?</p>

it’s a damn fool and keeps quiet, but when a hen

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Enters from door upper <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>) Forward
march! (<i>Six sandwich-men enter door upper <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>,
bearing boards: “13 Soap—unlucky for dirt”</i>)
Halt! (<i>They stop</i>) Now, you understand you’re
all to go down to Mr. Cyrus Martin’s office, 226<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Broadway, and parade there all day—and to-morrow
the same thing. Be in front of his house to-night
at six sharp, you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandwich Men.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Then forward march! (<i>They exit
through door <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <span class="smcap">Rodney</span> goes to his desk. Business
with papers, etc. <span class="smcap">Peale</span> enters from door

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Hello, little boss. Holy Peter Piper,
you’ve shaved off your mustache!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Grinning</i>) Yes, I’m just beginning
to get on to myself. By George, I certainly used to
look like the devil. Do you observe the clothes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i><span class="allsmcap">R. C.</span> Crosses up; removes coat, and
places it <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> of <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> corner <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> of desk</i>) Why, you are
getting to be a regular business man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Business is great stuff. I thought it’d
bore me, but it’s immense; it’s the best game I ever
played. What’s the news with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> We only just got back from Buffalo this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Sits in chair <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> of desk</i>) Yes, your
father and I. He went to the Iroquois in Buffalo.
I had all the billboards in the neighborhood plastered
thick—and 48-sheet stands along the streets to the
Union Station. From the time the old man got in
until he got out, he couldn’t look anywhere without
seeing 13 Soap. I even found out the number of
his room and had a small balloon floating 13 Soap
streamers right outside his window. I took a page
in all the Buffalo papers—bribed the hat boy to keep
putting circulars in his hat every time he checked
it, and sent him one of our new folders every mail.
They have eight mails a day in Buffalo. I came back
with him on the train and when he went into the
washroom last night I had the porter say “Sorry,
sir, we ain’t got no Thirteen Soap, but you can’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
hardly keep any on hand—it’s such grand, grand
soap.” (<i>Rises and crosses to <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Gee, that’s great. (<i>Crosses to <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, what’s on for to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’ve got a bully new advertising scheme.
When you go into a barber shop where do you
look?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> At the manicure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, no, at the ceiling—we’ll put ads on
all the barber’s ceilings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Scornfully</i>) Old stuff! It’s been done—is
that what you call a new scheme?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Well, that wasn’t my big idea. (<i>Goes
up-stage, sits in chair behind desk</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Mockingly</i>) No? Well, what is your
big idea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Plans for our new factory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Plans for what? Have you gone dippy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Here they are. (<i>He produces large
blue-print</i>) Pretty real looking, aren’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You don’t mean you’ve actually got some
nut to build us a factory?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, no, they are for father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, yes, I must admit that is some idea.
(<i>Takes blue-print</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> If he ever does drop in to make a deal
I thought we ought to have something to make a
front, something that looks like a plant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> <i>Plant</i> is right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And by the way, if we can, let it leak
out that it’s the Ivory Soap people who are backing
us with unlimited capital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> The Ivory Soap people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Sure, father’s always hated ’em in
business. His oldest friend, though, is John Clark,
one of the big bugs in Ivory Soap. Clark’s got a
son, Ellery, that father dislikes because he’s such a
success in business—always held him up to me as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
model son to pattern by. It’d make father wild if
he thought that old Clark was going to back us;
Ivory Soap’s the only bunch he’s never been able
to lick. (<i>Rises and goes down <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Goes down <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) Then that scheme ought
to be good for a great rise out of father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Say, by the way, I put over a corker
on him this morning: I arranged for a parade of
sandwich-men up and down in front of his house.
I just sent another bunch to his office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, we’re bound to land him sooner or
later, keeping after him the way we have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Funny, though, nobody’s tried to buy
any soap from us yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, it takes time to create a demand.
These 200 cakes of pink castile you bought looked
swell in our old rose wrappers, didn’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Say, where’s Miss Grayson? Have you
seen her to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> No, and it’s after eleven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’ll bet she was here before either of
us—she always is. By George, isn’t she a corker?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Indifferently</i>) Oh, she’s all right.
(<i>Takes pad and pencil from pocket and sits in arm-chair
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> All right!? Why, the girls you read
about don’t mean anything compared to Mary.
She’s got Juliet beat a mile. Every time I think
of her I want to yell or do some darn fool thing,
and every time I see her I just want to get down and
kiss her shoes. I just want to walk around after
her all the rest of my life and say “Are you comfortable,
my love? Are you happy? If there is anything
on the wide earth you want, let me get it for
you, Mary.” What a wonderful name that is—just
like her, simple and honest and beautiful! Mary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Reflectively</i>) If we could only land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
one hard wallop on father after that Buffalo business!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Indignantly</i>) Didn’t you hear what I
said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Not a word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I was talking about Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I know you were. That’s why I didn’t
listen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Good-morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>) Ah, you’re here—now
everything’s all right, it’s a great world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Don’t be silly; this is a business office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> By George, Mary——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Miss Grayson!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> By George, Miss Grayson, you do look
simply stunning! You’re twice as pretty to-day as
you were yesterday, and to-morrow you’ll be——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Hey, hey, change the record or put on a
soft needle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Peale</span></i>) Quite right—in business
hours, only business. (<i>Takes list of assets and
liabilities from case</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But you are the prettiest thing——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Never mind that—you listen to me. This
firm’s broke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> That we can’t be——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> It must be some mistake in the books——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Is it? I was surprised myself when I
balanced our accounts this morning. I have here
a statement of our assets and liabilities. We owe
$22,818.09.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> What’s the 9 cents for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What are our assets?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> $133.13.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> That’s quite a showing for a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Mr. McChesney, the advertising man, was
here this morning, and he won’t wait any longer for
his money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But we paid him $5,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Looking at statement</i>) Yes, and owe
him $9,400. And unless he has $2,500 of it to-day
he’ll put you out of business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> That’s the trouble of dealing with business
men. They’re so particular about being paid.
Now, you take a lot of actors——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But what about McChesney?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes, what are we going to do when
McChesney comes here to-day for money—cash?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, we don’t do any more business with
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No, I guess we won’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, don’t you worry, old son, we’ll fix
father somehow. Nobody can stop good advertising.
Why, I met a little fellow on the train last
night. He gets $50,000 a year just for writing ads.
He says a good trade-mark is 70% of the battle, and
we’ve got the best trade-mark I ever heard of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You think we ought to keep on advertising?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Sure, if we can get credit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I suppose we might as well owe forty
thousand as twenty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Absolutely. Half of all modern advertising
success is based on a good trade-mark, and ours
is a bird.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> By George, that’s true, we simply have
got to keep going. We’ll manage somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I like to hear you say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Now you’re talking. We’ll conduct the
greatest campaign since George W. Advertising was
a young man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What does she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Grabbing letter, and looking at it</i>) Oh,
French stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> She says she was delayed abroad, but
that she’s due to-day on the Imper<i>a</i>tor or Rotter

coming to see us at eleven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It’s half-past eleven now. Oh, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Fear not. Remember, though a Countess,
she is still a woman: give her time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Does she say anything about the $15,000?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, I’ve got a hunch everything’s going
to be all right, or she wouldn’t have written us at
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Her $15,000’ll keep us going for quite
a while.</p>

Mac?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McChesney.</span> (<i>Throwing him off</i>) You may be
in the soap business, but cut out the soft soap with
me. Where’s my money? Have you got it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Why—er—the fact is——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McChesney.</span> That means you haven’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Well, you see——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McChesney.</span> That doesn’t go with me. Do you
think you can put me off? You can bet your blooming
liabilities you can’t. I think this whole concern
is bunk and I’m going after you good——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I don’t care for that kind of loud talk.
Drop it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Drop it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McChesney.</span> (<i>Surprised</i>) What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> He said, drop it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s simply that I haven’t had time to
examine your bill in detail. This afternoon, however,
I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McChesney.</span> I’ve heard that before. Now, see
here, Mr. Martin—your father’s an honest man:
he won’t stand for his son not paying me my
money. I’ll see him now. (<i>He starts for door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Wait a minute, wait a minute. I’ll give
you a check for $2,500 on account. I presume that
will be satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McChesney.</span> (<i>Taken aback</i>) Why, yes—sure—but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You understand, Mr. Peale, that not a
cent of that fifty thousand dollars we appropriated
for our October advertising campaign is to go to
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McChesney.</span> Now, Mr. Martin, I’ll admit I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
hasty tempered. I’m sorry I made a mistake, but a
contract is a contract and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Here’s your check. Good-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McChesney.</span> But, Mr. Martin——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Show Mr. McChesney out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Goes to <span class="smcap">McChesney</span>, takes his arm and

I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Rises and goes to <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) No, you’ve
only got us into more difficulty. You know, there’s
no money in the bank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But the check won’t go through the
clearing-house until to-morrow morning and by
then we’ll have the $15,000 from the Countess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> But where is the Countess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I’ll go telephone now to see if the Imperator’s

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What is it, Mr. Clark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> You see, it’s like this, old top. I’ve been
having rather a time with father lately—silly old
man—insisted on the absurd idea of my going into
business. Beastly bore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But you wanted to do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I should say not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But I thought you loved work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> It’s a preposterous idea—men of intelligence
go in for the professions. I paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Half aside</i>) You look it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’d heard you were a model son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> But I don’t consider it a compliment to
be a success in business—think of all the blighters
who are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, the bally rotters!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Father keeps reminding me of your
success every day—most irritating. You see, of
course he’s sore, because I never bothered much
about business. Oh, I have tackled a thing or two.
But luck was always against me. It just happened
it didn’t work out right. Not my fault, you understand?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You couldn’t be to blame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Of course, if I ever devoted myself to
business! But, after all, when you know you can
do a thing you want to, why bother to do it, if it
bores you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, life is a damn nuisance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> (<i>Sighing</i>) And father has been so
offensive lately, I’ve decided to give a little time
to business and make a success of it. I can, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Seems simple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Oh, rather. I have it all figured out.
For my scheme I’ve got to raise seventy-five hundred
dollars, and I wanted to talk to you about it.
This idea of mine is an automobile proposition.
I really need $10,000, and I’ve only got $2,500.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> and <span class="smcap">Peale</span> exchange looks and walk over
to <span class="smcap">Ellery</span>, one on each side of him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Ellery, why do you want to go into the
automobile business? It’s dangerous—unsafe——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> The risk’s tremendous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Ellery, our families are old friends.
Now, if you really want to show your father you’re
a money-maker, why don’t you buy some shares in
our company?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I don’t care much about the idea of
being in the soap business—rather vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But you don’t have to be in the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Absolutely not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s a very simple proposition. All you
do is invest and then sit still and deposit your checks
when we pay dividends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I say, that sounds a bit better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We’re not letting the general public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
in—but it’d be such a joke on your father for you
to make money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Yes, wouldn’t it? (<i>They all laugh</i>)
I fancy he’d be mighty glad I had sense enough to
go in with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes, wouldn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> But is it a safe investment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Why, we’d guarantee you against loss
from our assets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, from our assets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> That sounds rather ripping. But what
would I get for my twenty-five hundred?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> A receipt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I know, I know, but what interest in
the business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Two and one-half per cent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I say, is that much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Think what two and a half per cent in
the steel trust would mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> And more people use soap than steel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> (<i>Wisely</i>) Isn’t steel dearer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s quantity that counts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Four cakes a year to every person in this
country would represent an annual output of 400,000,000
cakes—and think of all the babies who’ll
be born next year. They’ll all have to be washed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Very true, very true. What is the
annual birth-rate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Let me see, let me see; do you know,
Peale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> There’s one born every minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I fancy that’s true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> You can bet it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Now, what do you say, Ellery, about
investing in our company?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> (<i>After a long pause, rises and shakes
hands with <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) I’ll do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> God’s in His Heaven, all’s right with
the world! (<i>Crosses <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Have you the money with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Why, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Then you’ll send us a check to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I don’t get the money until next week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Father didn’t promise it to me till next
Monday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Well, ask him for it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Oh, I’m afraid I can’t. He’s out of
town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We can’t agree to hold the matter open
until next Monday. (<i>Goes to chair behind desk
and sits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> No, not till way next Monday. Why
don’t you telephone him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Yes, that wouldn’t be so distressing. If
I can get him—I find him considerably easier to
talk to on the ’phone. I can always ring off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Come this way—it’ll be quieter for you
if he’s noisy. (<i>Goes to <span class="smcap">Ellery</span>, takes his arm, and

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Enters door lower <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>) Oh, how do you
do, Mr. Clark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Oh, how do you do? (<i>They shake
hands</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Pushing him out</i>) Never mind the
social chatter. Ellery, you don’t mind my calling
you Ellery—do you, Ellery? (<i>To her</i>) You see,
Ellery has work to do. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Ellery</span>. <span class="smcap">Mary</span> goes

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Three hours ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, Rodney, did you find out how well
Ellery’s doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, great! Hasn’t made a cent.
Wanted to borrow some money from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Your father’d be glad to hear that.</p>

yourselves. I came to trim your father. You remember,
I wanted to see him, but I looked so soft
you thought you’d grab me off and sell me the
French agency of your Thirteen Soap. I didn’t
think your father could be as big a boob as you were,

is, I can’t waste my time.</p>

she give you the money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, and she nearly got us for five thousand
dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> She’s a fake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> The swindler! And the man from the
Edison Company is here to say that unless they get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
some money at once they’ll cut off the current from
all our signs, and the agent of the landlord is waiting
for the rent. He seems very suspicious and
wants to be paid for last month right away. What
can I say to them?</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> shakes his head.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, please send for your father and give
in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You know I want you to succeed, but
there’s no use fighting odds like these—you haven’t
any money, you’re way in debt, and you mustn’t be
disgraced. Please send for your father. I’m sure
he’ll help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I wonder if I’d better? What do you
think, Peale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Do telephone him right away. (<i>Crosses
to door lower <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>) Now I must try to fix the Edison
man and the landlord, or they’ll be in here. (<i>To
<span class="smcap">Peale</span></i>) What can I say to them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, I’ll say you’re both out. (<i>She exits
door lower <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> That’ll be a new one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Do you happen to know the sheriff?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Not yet. I’d like to have a pull enough
to get a cell with a southern exposure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What are we going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What are you here for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I know, but I can’t think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Burke.</span> (<i>Entering</i>) Mr. Cyrus Martin to
see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rodney</span>. Who?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Burke.</span> Mr. Cyrus Martin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Have him wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Have him what? (<i>Rises and goes to
<span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Just a minute till I think. When I
ring, show him in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Burke.</span> Yes, sir. (<i>She exits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> He must be here to make a deal. Our
scheme worked—we’ve put it over, and what did it?
Advertising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But father’s no fool. We’ve got to be
very careful. How’ll we handle it? I’m not used
to putting it over on father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Don’t forget the factory and the Ivory
Soap people and the plans, and get busy. You know.
(<i>He makes motions and brings letter-file from
rack and throws contents on desk</i>) That rubber-stamp
stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But isn’t this playing it rather low
down on father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, don’t get cold feet now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We really haven’t anything to sell him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, we have—a trade-mark. You know
it’s good, so do I. We only need your father to
back us and we’ll make a lot of money for him in
spite of himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I guess that’s true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Sure it is, and anyhow all’s fair in love
and business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> (<i>Coming in at private door left</i>) Oh, I
beg pardon, but I was so fascinated at meeting the
Countess, I forgot my stick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Can’t see you now, Ellery. (<i>He goes
over and pulls down two windows shades on which
are painted ads of 13 Soap</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Giving him gloves</i>) No, can’t ever see
you again, Ellery. Here’s your cane. Now, hurry,
Ellery. (<i>He starts to lead him to door</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> The Countess is perfectly delightful—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Suddenly goes to <span class="smcap">Ellery</span></i>) Hold on,
hold on, Ellery, can you wait in there five minutes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> (<i>Pausing</i>) But the Countess is downstairs
in a taxi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, she’ll wait for you, and charge the
taxi to Mr. Peale. He’ll be right in and explain
everything to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, yes, I’ll explain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I don’t want to detain the Countess too
long. Hate to keep a lady waiting—all that sort of
thing. You know what women are. (<i>He exits left</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Now, what is it, what do you want that
gink for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Don’t you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> No, I’m near-sighted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> He’s the son of Ivory Soap. Coach
him with some important message from old John
Clark to us about a merger, and when father begins
to wabble, have Ellery come in with the message.
That’ll send father kerflop to the mat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Going</i>) Master! Great, great, I get
you. I’ll fix Ellery. This is your father’s Waterloo.
(<i>At door</i>) As soon as I’ve taught Ellery his
lesson I’ll be right back. I’ll tell him when we ring
the bell twice, to bust in with his little recitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But don’t let him get on to our game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> He couldn’t get on to anything but a
weighing machine. (<i>He goes out left</i>)</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> pushes the buzzer and then takes up the
’phone, keeping his eye on the door. In a
moment <span class="smcap">Cyrus Martin</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, much obliged, but we can’t consider
it. No stock for sale—it’s quite out of the question.
Good-bye. (<i>Ringing off and then pretending to be
surprised, turns and sees his father</i>) Why, hello,
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Hello, son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> gets very busy with papers
and rubber-stamp</i>) Sit down, won’t you? Be with
you in just a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Drily</i>) Thanks.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> very busy again with filing papers and
opening and closing drawers. <span class="smcap">Martin</span> looks
at him in astonishment.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Have a cigar? (<i>He abstractedly passes
him a box</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Thanks—(<i>He bites off end and lights
it, and as he does so, <span class="smcap">Rodney</span> again gets busy with
similar business</i>) Surprised to see me, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Not a bit. (<i>He starts signing a contract.
<span class="smcap">Martin</span>, who has risen, attempts to glance
at it, and as he does so, <span class="smcap">Rodney</span> calmly turns it over
and blots it. <span class="smcap">Martin</span> turns away</i>) There, that’s
done! Now, father, what can I do for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, my boy—I just dropped in for a
social call. The fact is, I’ve rather missed you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’ve missed you too, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Abruptly</i>) Thought I’d have a look
in and find out how things were going. (<i>Sits in arm-chair
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Fine—fine—everything’s breezing right
along. Of course, I’m always glad to see you, but
right now, father I’m pretty busy, so you’ll excuse
me if—(<i>He gets busy again with rubber-stamp</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>With a certain sarcasm</i>) Well, if
you can spare the time, I’d like a little business talk
with you, Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Certainly, in just a minute. (<i>Gets busy
with papers. Pushes the buzzer</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Entering</i>) Oh, excuse me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> That’s all right, come right in. Father,
you remember Mr. Peale—Peale, my father——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Indeed yes, I recall very well——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Gruffly cutting him off</i>) How are
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Sitting in chair left</i>) A bit tired—just
back from Buffalo where I’ve been conducting a
big campaign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Then it is to you I should address myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Either or both of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Rises and goes to desk</i>) Then both of
you listen to me. You’ve got to cut out this nonsense
you call advertising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What nonsense?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Weakly</i>) Yes, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> This morning there was a parade of
sandwich-men in front of my house for two hours.
I had to have them arrested. I got to the office to
find another bunch. It annoys me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’m sorry, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You’re trying to make a fool of me.
I open a letter. It’s a circular for 13 Soap. I open
my newspaper—you have a page ad. I look out
of the window—there’s a billboard—I take a train,
the damned porter apologizes because he’s all out
of 13 Soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Well, of course, all that proves how
wonderful our publicity is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Grimly</i>) You’re a grand young bluff,
my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Why, father, what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I’ll tell you exactly what I mean: I’ve
let you ramble on to see just how far you would go,
but you’ve been spending a lot of money on
ridiculous advertising, hoping that by annoying me
I’ll buy your business to get rid of you. Well, I’m
not going to. Now what have you got to say to
that? Eh—eh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Rises quickly</i>) Nothing—absolutely
nothing. (<i>Sits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) But I have a lot to say.
We may not have a big business now, but we have
got a trade-mark, the catchiest trade-mark ever invented
for soap. We’re a growing concern. Just
because our advertising annoys you, you mustn’t
think it’s valueless. Why, it’s so good that capital
is chasing us: our money is practically unlimited. Is
that a fair statement, Peale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Dazed at <span class="smcap">Rodney’s</span> bluff</i>) Very fair—very
fair indeed——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Bluff, son, bluff!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Not at all. And since you’re so
skeptical, father, I don’t mind letting you see the
plans for our new factory. (<i>Takes plans from
desk</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> New factory?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes, father—these are the offices, this
is Miss Grayson’s office, this is Mr. Peale’s office, and
this is mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, aren’t you going to make any
soap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Right here, where our capacity will
be——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Who’s putting up the money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Reprovingly</i>) Now, father, you cannot
expect me to divulge a business secret to you,
a rival manufacturer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, why not tell him, he is your father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Well, Peale, if you really think it is
wise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, yes, I think it’s quite wise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s the Ivory Soap people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>At once impressed and annoyed</i>)
The Ivory Soap people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Rises and goes to desk. Rubbing it in</i>)
Yes, the Ivory Soap people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You mean John Clark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Absolutely. (<i><span class="smcap">Martin</span> turns and reflectively
walks up-stage. <span class="smcap">Peale</span> very obviously picks
up push-button and pushes buzzer twice; it rings
off left. There is a pause, and then in a moment,
<span class="smcap">Ellery</span> enters</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Oh, excuse me. I didn’t know your
father was here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Very genially</i>) That’s all right,
Ellery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>The same</i>) Come right in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> How do you do, Mr. Martin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Gruffly</i>) How are you, Ellery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Well, I really can’t wait any longer.
The party downstairs in the taxi—you follow me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, Ellery you told us that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> Well, good-bye, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Was that all you came in to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> (<i>Remembering</i>) Oh, yes, of course.
If you’ll keep it open until Monday I’ll get the
money for you then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But we can’t wait till Monday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> But Mr. Peale told me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Interrupting quickly</i>) We’ll see what
we can do, but just now, Ellery, we’re very much
occupied. (<i>He has him by the arm</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Oh, just a minute: you’d better give
your father back the plans—say they’re quite satisfactory.
(<i>Gives plans to <span class="smcap">Peale</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> What plans?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Don’t you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> That’s too bad. Well, good-bye, Ellery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellery.</span> I say, I do find business very confusing.
(<i>He exits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>As he comes back</i>) Ellery talks too
much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> He is very indiscreet—if it had been
anybody but father he’d have given our whole plan
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What’s he doing here—acting for his
father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You’re not going to take him in—that
pin-head? Why, he didn’t even seem to know what
he was <i>trying</i> to get at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> No, he didn’t, did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But after all, he does represent Ivory
Soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Great soap, Ivory! Over 99 per cent
pure. (<i>Sits in arm-chair <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Grunting</i>) Ivory Soap? (<i>He walks
up and down while <span class="smcap">Rodney</span> and <span class="smcap">Peale</span> exchange
gleeful glances. After a considerable pause</i>) Well,
thinking things over, why should you and I fight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> You began it, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Quite true, and therefore I should be
the one to call it off. Now, son, here’s the idea: I’d
rather have you with me than against me—the
money doesn’t matter much. In your way, while
I don’t endorse that kind of publicity, I suppose
you boys think your sensational ads are good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Not at all. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) And if
you’re going to have a backer, wouldn’t I be better
than the Ivory Soap people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> After all, blood is thicker than business.
What do you suggest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Suppose I buy you out—including your
trade-mark and goodwill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, you have our goodwill now, sir.
(<i>Rises and bows very profusely, then sits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Reflectively</i>) Buying us out might
be expensive for you, father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Oh, I guess it won’t take all the money
I’ve got. What’s your proposition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What’s yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, I’ll give you $50,000 for your
business as it stands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But we don’t want to give up our business.
I like business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Grandly</i>) We wish to continue in our
chosen profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, suppose you take 25% of the
profits in addition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It’s a wonderful autumn, isn’t it?
These crisp cold bracing mornings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, I hardly thought you’d grab at
that. What will you take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Rising quickly</i>) One hundred thousand
dollars cash, you assume all the contracts and
obligations of this company, give us 40% of the
profits, a contract for me at $20,000 a year; for
Miss Grayson at $10,000, (<i><span class="smcap">Peale</span> coughs</i>)—and
another for Mr. Peale at the same figure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Done. (<i>Shakes hands with <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>)</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Peale</span> and <span class="smcap">Rodney</span> exchange looks and shake
hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I congratulate you, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You needn’t. Your trade-mark might
appeal to a lot of superstitious idiots, but as a business
proposition I don’t think much of it. But now
I’ll show old John Clark he can’t butt into my family
affairs or get Ellery mixed up with my boy’s business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes, father, we’d much rather have you
than Ellery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, <i>much rather</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Burke.</span> (<i>Entering</i>) Oh, Mr. Martin!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Going to her</i>) That’s for me, father.
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Miss Burke</span></i>) What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Burke.</span> The agent for the landlord says
he’s got to see you immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Motioning her to be quiet</i>) I’ll be
right out. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Martin</span>, very nervously</i>) You see,
father, we’re thinking of taking larger offices.
Come, Peale. We’ll be right back, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, father, we’ll be right back. (<i>They
hurriedly exit</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Stands there watching them proudly.

Grayson, it’s mighty good to see you again—I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, Mr. Martin, I’m so glad Rodney
finally sent for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Surprised</i>) Sent for me? (<i>Goes in
front of desk</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Have you talked to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Oh, yes, he just went out for a minute
to see the agent of the landlord——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, then he told you about that? (<i>Goes
to him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Puzzled</i>) Yes, he told me—why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I am so glad to think he wasn’t ashamed
to tell you the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Oh, Rodney always was a truthful lad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, I’m so happy you’ve settled with
him! You have settled, haven’t you? (<i>Goes to arm-chair

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes, sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, good. Isn’t it wonderful for him?
(<i>Very sweetly</i>) Just think! Without you he
couldn’t have lasted out the day. (<i>Crossing down in
front of desk</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Couldn’t have lasted out the day, ha,
ha! Then our little scheme to put Rodney on his
feet didn’t work?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But everything’s all right now. You’re
going to help him——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Everything’s great now—(<i>Knocked off
his feet, then recovering himself</i>) Oh, by the way,
in our negotiations the one thing that Rodney didn’t
fully go into was the nature of the assets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> The assets! They must have made even
you laugh. Why, we haven’t any! (<i>She laughs</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Trying to laugh</i>) Haven’t any!
Ha—ha—by the way, there was a report on the
Street to-day that the Ivory Soap people were going
to make a deal with Rodney—build him a factory—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Innocently</i>) Oh, there’s nothing in
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Are you sure? As I got here, I thought
I saw Ellery Clark leaving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, he didn’t come here on business:
Ellery came to borrow some money from Rodney—isn’t
that funny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Oh, yes, very funny—but the plans?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Rodney showed you some plans? He
must have been joking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Changing his whole manner</i>) The
young scoundrel! (<i>Starts to go up-stage</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Stops</i>) Thank you, Miss Grayson,
for telling me. Do you know what he tried to do to
me? Hold me up for a hundred thousand dollars,
make me think Ivory Soap was backing him, too—and
but for you, he’d have succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What have I done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You saved me a lot of money and kept
me from being a fool. Thank you! Good-morning.
(<i>Starts for door upper <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You mean at last he’d succeeded in getting
you to back him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> At last! (<i>Coming to her, lays hat on
desk</i>) So that was his scheme all the time, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
it? He didn’t go into business on the level, but just
for my benefit? And you were helping him. Well,
he can thank you again for having failed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> It’s all my fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes it is, from the start. You got up
the plan of my pretending to put him out of the
house——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, but I tell you, you must help him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Help him yourself. You’ve got $5,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But I gave it to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> My son took money from you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> He didn’t know—I pretended it was from
a friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, you got him in; now you can
get him out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But your bet—you bet $30,000 with
John Clark. You don’t want to lose that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, if Ellery’s trying to borrow
money from Rodney it looks like an even break—and
anyhow I’d lose the bet twice over rather than
have my son think he could make a fool of his
father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But he is a good business man: he’d make
you proud of him. You don’t know how hard he’s
worked, how fine he’s been; he’s simply wonderful.
If he could keep on a little longer, I know
he’d succeed. If you’ll just help him, he’ll make
money. You’ll see he will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Of course, you want him to make
money. You’re thinking of that percentage contract
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I’m not! Oh, I’m not! I can’t see him
fail. Listen: I’ll try to give you back what you’ve
given me—I don’t care anything about the contract.
I’ll tear it up now if you’ll just help him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> By George, I believe you really are in
love with him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Proudly</i>) Yes, I am—now. But that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
doesn’t matter. We’ve got to save him—save his
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I won’t give him a nickel. Good-bye!
(<i>Starts to go</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But you can’t go like this: he’ll be disgraced!
He’s in debt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Let him get out of it—it’ll do him
good. I’ve been a sentimental fool. I’ve made it
all too easy for him. (<i>Coming down <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But that’s your fault, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes it is, and I don’t propose to repeat
the error. He’s lied to me all the way through.
We’ll let him face the truth; now we’ll see what he’s
made of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>With satisfaction</i>) Ah!</p>

no money to work with are enough to stop me? No,
sir; what father said got me for a minute, but I’m
not a quitter, and I’ll prove it. There must be something
of father in me: I can’t be such a pin-head
as I look. I’ll get out of this mess the best way I
can, and then I’ll shine shoes or sell peanuts. I’ll
start at the bottom instead of finishing there. I’ll

well. (<i>Crossing to <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> side of <span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> We’ve still got 45,000 cakes to deliver,
if we can get ’em from you. Why let all that money
get out of the family? It’s a business proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> No, it isn’t. Don’t fool yourself: I sent
that telegram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What telegram?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> The telegram from Marshall Field’s
ordering the 50,000 cakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You sent it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> That day at the office you were pretty
game, son, and to tell the truth, I felt so sorry for
you, I kind of had to do something, so I sent that
wire——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> So that success is all a bluff, too? (<i>Sits
on sofa</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But what did you do it for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, I figured an order like that would
stall off your creditors, and then I had fixed it with
one of our factories to let you have 5,000 cakes at
three cents a cake. I knew it would mean some
ready cash for you from Marshall Field——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> But how did you square Marshall Field?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Oh, I just wired ’em I’d be responsible,
and, say—(<i>Turning to <span class="smcap">Rodney</span>, who rises</i>) you
had a nerve to charge ’em sixty cents a cake—and I
had to pay the bill! That shipment cost me $3,000
for $150 worth of soap. (<i><span class="smcap">Peale</span> laughs</i>) That
isn’t funny, young man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> No, it isn’t: I thought we’d really made
good, and all the time it was you behind us——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You see, my boy, even if you did
nearly trim me, I’ve got a sort of sneaking fondness
for you. Look here, son, why not quit? There’s no
market for dollar soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But how do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I had a letter from Marshall Field a
few days ago asking me what to do with the soap.
They hadn’t sold a cake. I told ’em to dump it in
the Chicago River; it might help to clean it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> But you didn’t give our advertising a
chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> We only finished a great big advertising
campaign in Chicago two days ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I know the soap’ll make good—with
that trade-mark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> If your trade-mark was so marvelous,
somebody besides your poor old father would have
bought your soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, what’s the use? He doesn’t believe
in advertising!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Oh, yes, I do: sound, conservative advertising,
but not the crazy, sensational stuff you go
in for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, you’re just mad because the soap
trust didn’t think of 13 Soap itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Why, we wouldn’t touch a fool thing
like that. If you deliver the goods, your goods will
advertise you—that’s always been our policy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’m sorry, father, but you are old-fashioned
to knock the modern way of advertising.
Why, do you know, the National Biscuit Company
was on the verge of failing until they hit on the
title, Uneeda Biscuit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And since then, they have had over four
hundred lawsuits to protect it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Their trade-mark made ’em. They
value that trade-mark now at six million dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Great stuff. (<i>Turning to <span class="smcap">Martin</span></i>)—and
Spearmint Gum just as a trade-mark is worth seven
millions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And the Fairbanks people count their
trade-mark, The Gold Dust Twins, at $10,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Ever hear of the Gillette Safety Razor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I use it myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Tell him about it, Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> It costs you five dollars. Don’t you
know there’s a mighty good safety razor for a
quarter, and dozens at a dollar, but you use the
Gillette because Gillette was there first; you buy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
his razor at a high price simply because of its trade-mark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>With gesture</i>) Advertising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>With gesture</i>) Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Ivory Soap in the magazines alone used
$450,000 worth of space in 1913—and at three cents
a cake wholesale, that represents 15,000,000 cakes
for magazine advertising alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I don’t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, and a lot of other guys didn’t believe
that iron ships would float or that machines heavier
than air would fly, or that you could talk to ’Frisco
on a wire or send a message across the Atlantic
without a wire. Pardon me, sir, but you want to
get on to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Yes, father, you certainly do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And you’d better hurry up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You’ve got a fine lot of theories, but
what have they done for those 5,000 cakes of 13
Soap out at Marshall Field’s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Why, we haven’t really spent enough
money advertising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> That’s true. Every time the American
Tobacco Company puts out a new cigarette they
start off by appropriating $200,000 to boom it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> And I suppose they are a lot of boobs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And think what other firms spend! I’ve
gone into this thing, father——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes, Rodney, let’s show him our list.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Sure, it’s an absolutely accurate list of
what some of the big advertisers spent in the thirty-one
leading magazines last year. Eastman Kodak,
$400,000, Postum Coffee, $125,000, Arrow Collars,
$400,000, Melachrino Cigarettes, $100,000, Welch’s
Grape Juice, $100,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Grape Juice, my friend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Uneeda Biscuit, $150,000. Spearmint
Gum, $140,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> That’s enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> I’ve only just begun. Grape Nuts,
$228,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Colgate’s Dental Cream, $230,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Campbell’s Soups, $186,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Kellogg’s Toasted Cornflakes, $200,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Quaker Oats, $367,000, and these are
only a few. You can’t see how it pays, but you do
know that it must pay or they wouldn’t do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes. Does it when you realize that those
thirty-one magazines have only about 10,000,000
readers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> And that there are a hundred million
people in this country. Why just to appeal to one-tenth
of the population, fifty million dollars was
spent in magazines last year, and each year people
are getting better educated—more people are wanting
to read. It won’t be long before there are 25,000,000
people buying magazines, and you can reach
all of them by advertising—get a new market, a new
population to deal with. Think what national advertising
is accomplishing! It sells automobiles,
vacuum cleaners, talking machines, rubber heels,
kodaks, washing machines, foods, clothes, shoes,
paints, houses, plumbing, electric irons, fireless
cookers—mostly to a lot of people who’d never even
hear of ’em if it weren’t for advertisements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> But nowadays it isn’t only people who
have stoves to sell or tooth-brushes, that are spending
money on publicity. Banks are advertising for
money, nations for immigrants, colleges for students,
cities for citizens, and churches for congregations,
and you sit there thinking it doesn’t pay to advertise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Six hundred and sixteen million dollars
were spent last year in magazines and newspapers,
billboards and electric signs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Bringing education and comfort and
fun and luxury to the people of the United States.
It’s romance, father, the romance of printing-presses,
of steel rails, of the wireless, of trains and competition,
the romance of modern business, and it’s all
built on advertising. Advertising is the biggest thing
in this country, and it’s only just begun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>After a pause</i>) Why didn’t you boys
go into the advertising business? You seem to know
something about that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Fairly tearing his hair</i>) Oh, what’s the
use! He’s the old school—we’re new blood. (<i>Coming
to <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> of <span class="allsmcap">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>With enthusiasm</i>) Youth has got it
on old age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Coming down between <span class="smcap">Peale</span> and
<span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) You bet it has!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> When you boys get through talking and
you’re flat broke and down and out, come around
and see me: I’ll show you an old business that has
a lot of money that isn’t radical and manages to keep
going without wasting a fortune in fool advertising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Then you won’t let us get any soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Risk my business reputation on a silly
scheme like Dollar Soap? I should say not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Oh, come on. What’s the use of talking
to a man whose brain is deaf? (<i>Exit door upper
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, keeping in step, single-file</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Rises and comes to center</i>) Say
when you get a new line of patter, come around. I
like to hear you. Dollar Soap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> (<i>Enters</i>) I beg pardon, a gentleman
to see you, sir. (<i><span class="smcap">Johnson</span> hands <span class="smcap">Martin</span> a card on
silver tray</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> “Mr. Charles Bronson.” What does
he want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> He says he’s from Marshall Field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Oh, a kick, I suppose? Send him in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Yes, sir. (<i>He exits</i>)</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Bronson</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> (<i>Inquiringly</i>) Mr. Martin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> I just arrived from Chicago. I am
here in reference to the 13 Soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Be seated. Well, what about it? (<i>Sits
in chair <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> of table</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> (<i>Sits in chair <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> of desk</i>) While, of
course, we understand that the 13 Soap is made by
your son, Mr. Rodney Martin, at the same time as
you wired us you would be responsible for that
order, Marshall Field felt that I should first see you
in the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Humph!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> We realize, of course, that you are
backing your son——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Gruffly</i>) Well, why shouldn’t I back
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> Of course, of course. That is why
we’d like to place our order through you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Amazed</i>) Place your what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> Through some error we received only
5,000 cakes, instead of 50,000 but that’s all gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> All gone? What happened to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> We’ve sold it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Sold it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> Yes, and we want the balance of the
original order you were kind enough to throw our
way, and as much more soap as we can get.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> But only the other day I had a letter
from Marshall Field saying they hadn’t sold a cake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) I know, I know. We
felt at first that of course there could be no popular
market for a dollar soap; we weren’t as far-sighted
as you were. (<i><span class="smcap">Martin</span> clears his throat</i>) But of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
course, when those extraordinary advertisements
appeared, so different from your usual conservative
publicity, the sales began immediately! We sold the
5,000 cakes in two days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> And the advertising did it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> Of course, what else? Now we want
to handle your goods exclusively in the west—with
extensive immediate deliveries. Can that be arranged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> It ought to be. What do you offer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> I dare say we would contract for a
quarter of a million cakes of soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Amazed</i>) A quarter of a million!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> (<i>Misunderstanding him</i>) Of course
we might do a little better if we could settle the
matter at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I should have to consult my son first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) Oh, then perhaps I ought
to go see him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) Not at all—not at all. I’ll
attend to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> But we thought that you would have
full power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> As a matter of courtesy I should like
to talk things over with my own boy——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> But you control the product?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Bronson, you can trust me to handle
this thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> Of course, of course. When can I see
you again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> In half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> Very well. I’ve some matters to attend
to. I’ll be back in half an hour. (<i>Going to
door upper <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) It’s a wonderful soap, Mr. Martin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Dryly</i>) Oh, wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> See you in half an hour. (<i><span class="smcap">Bronson</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Wonderful soap—plain pink castile,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
I’ve got to get in on this. (<i>He goes to ’phone</i>)
1313 Bryant. Hello, is this the 13 Soap Company?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> (<i>Enters</i>) Oh, beg pardon, sir, but—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Just a minute. Is Mr. Rodney Martin
in? No? Never mind who I am. Good-bye.
Johnson, call up my son’s office every ten minutes
and let me know the minute he comes in. Don’t tell
’em who’s calling. (<i>Crosses to <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> And when Mr. Bronson comes back,
be sure to have him wait for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Yes, sir. There’s a lady to see you,
sir. She speaks English now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> She does, eh? That’s unusual, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> I mean, sir, when she was here two
months ago she could only talk French.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Indeed! Well, I’m not interested in the
languages she speaks. Who is she, and what does
she want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> She wishes to see you about the French
rights of the 13 Soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> The what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> The French rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Great Scott! Send her right in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Yes, sir. The Countess de Bowreen.
(<i>He exits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> (<i>Enters</i>) How do you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Comes down in front of table</i>) How
do you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> I am the Countess de Beaurien. Your
son have told you of me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> I bet he have not. He is a cheat—he
trick me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Now, my dear lady——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Attendez, you listen to me: two
months ago there in that very room, I buy the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
French rights for the 13 Soap. I pay him 15,000
dollar and now I cannot get any soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You will have to see my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> But I have seen him, and he give me
no satisfaction. If I cannot get any soap, I must
have my money, one or the other, or I put him in
the jail. He is a cheat. I have here ze contract. I
sue him in the court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> My dear lady, you mustn’t feel that
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Feel! Ah, mon dieu—I trick no one,
I play fair, I am an honest woman. Mais je vous
dis que je suis honnête, très honnête dans mes
affaires. Monsieur votre fils m’a donné le contrat,
et j’insiste qu’il est très malhonnête. Je n’ai pas
l’habitude d’être si maltraitée, monsieur, et je
répète que je ferai tout mon possible d’obtenir les
quinze mille dollars que me doit Monsieur votre
fils, et s’il ne me les donne pas, je le poursuivrai sans

contract from him</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> But I don’t understand French.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Pardon, Monsieur, always I am excited
I speak the French. But! If you love your
son, you pay me back, or else he go to jail. What
you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> But $15,000 is a lot of money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Yes. But it is more to me than it is
to you. You pay me, or he go to prison. Now what
you say?</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Johnson</span> enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> I beg pardon, a gentleman to see you,

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Comes to <span class="smcap">Johnson</span></i>) Is it Bronson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> No, sir. (<i><span class="smcap">Johnson</span> hands him card</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> By George, just the man I want to see!
Show him right in. Hold on, hold on. Now,
Duchess, if you don’t mind, just step in this room
a minute. (<i>Indicating room lower <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> No, no, I do not like that room: I
have been there before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Here is a nice room. (<i>Points to room

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Very well, I wait. (<i>Crosses to left</i>)
But in fifteen minutes if I do not get the 15,000
dollar, I go to my lawyers, and your son—poof! he is
done. (<i>Talking in French as she exits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Johnson</span></i>) Did you get my son’s

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Yes, sir—he hasn’t come in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> If you reach him while Mr. Peale’s

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Now, see here, young man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Now, one moment, Mr. Martin. I just
want to say that I am a man of few words—that
this isn’t advertising, it’s personal. I know you
don’t like me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Why do you say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Because I’m a pretty wise gink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, you are a bit——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Fresh? Well, I guess that’s right, too.
But that’s me—I’m not your style. Here’s the
idea: your son has been immense to me. Great kid,
and it struck me the reason you wouldn’t back him
was because I was mixed up in his business. So I
just came to say if that’s the situation, why I’m out,
that’s all. You go ahead with him alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You’re not a partner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I should say not. I’m just a hired hand.
He could can me any moment, but he’s not the kind
of guy who’d do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Then you haven’t power to sign, to
make a deal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I should say not. Why, he and Miss
Grayson do all the signing. If I could have signed
contracts, I’d have spent a million dollars in advertising.
And believe me, you ought to back him, because,
honest, Mr. Martin, it’s a great scheme—the
13 Soap, on the level, if it’s handled right and the
publicity end is——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Now don’t get started on advertising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> That’s right, too. Well, I guess that’s all.
I wanted to tell you how I stood about Rodney.
That’s off my chest, so good afternoon. (<i>Starts to
go</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Wait a minute. What did you boys
mean by trimming that poor Countess on the French
rights?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Jumping Jupiter; has she been here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> She’s here now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> What did she come to see you for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> She said she’d put Rodney in jail for
fraud unless I made good that $15,000. I’ve got to
pay her—can’t see the boy disgraced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Say, if you’d like to save that $15,000,
I’ll fix it for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> But she’s got a contract.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I’ll get it for you cheap. Pardon me, sir,
but I know how to handle dames like her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Mr. Peale, I like you. (<i>Slaps him on
shoulder</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Huh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> I just telephoned <i>that party</i>, he is at

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Good, good. Peale, I’ve got to go out
on an important soap deal. (<i>He starts to go,
then goes to <span class="smcap">Peale</span></i>) Oh, by George, I nearly
forgot. There’s another matter I must attend to
first. Peale, you’ll find the Countess in there. Do
the best you can—we’ll settle the details when I get
back. Make yourself at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Sure. This cigar’s great company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Good cigar, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Corker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Johnson, send over half a dozen boxes
of these cigars to Mr. Peale’s house. He’ll give you
the address. (<i>He exits left</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> And, say, Johnson, wrap ’em up now and
I’ll take ’em with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> Very good, sir. (<i>He exits. <span class="smcap">Peale</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>The telephone rings. <span class="smcap">Peale</span> looks at

Yes, Sweetie—this is the garage. How long does it
take to go to Coney Island? How in hell do I
know? (<i>Business of changing money and watch to

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Say, what are you doing in these parts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Oh, I came to see Mr. Martin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> What do you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> See here, now, if you’re aiming to trim
the old man, I won’t stand for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Ambrose, do me a favor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Don’t tell old Martin what I tried to
do to you boys. He’s the kind that would put me in
jail. I’ll be on the level. I did come here to try
to trim him, but I’ll cut it out. Honest, I will. Oh,
Ambrose, I don’t like being a grafter. I’ve had to
do a lot of things I didn’t want to. You don’t
know how hard it is for girls like me. I never had
a show. I ran away from home when I was a kid.
I’ve been pretty much up against it. Is what I’ve
done to other guys going to butt in and queer me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Nix, nix——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Give me a chance to be on the square.
It ain’t easy for a girl to fight it out all by herself
when she’s all alone: no money—no friends and
you got to live—live on five a week. You got a lot
for a good time, haven’t you? God, I’ve been
lonely sometimes; you’ve got to be pretty smart to
steer straight—but I’ve done it, I’ve done it, I’ve
done it. (<i>She breaks down and sits on chair <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> of
desk</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Kindly</i>) Now, see here, Countess—(<i>He
pats her on back</i>)—don’t do that—don’t, don’t—(<i>She
is sobbing a little</i>) Oh, quit it. (<i>A pause</i>)
Keep it for some poor boob who’ll fall for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> (<i>Tearfully</i>) Oh, Ambrose, don’t
talk like that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Say, honest, it’s foolish wasting it on me,
kid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> (<i>Completely changing to a radiant
smile. Rises</i>) Well, it’s always worth trying once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Genially</i>) Sure it is. Why, you had
me winging for a minute, but when you pulled that
wheeze about “I’ve done it,” three times in succession,
I knew it was phoney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> But, honest, I was on the level about
old Martin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Nix, nix, you came here to trim him for
the $15,000 on the French rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Gosh, have you seen him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, he left me here to settle it. Where’s
the contract? Come on—gimme—gimme——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> You mean you’ve been on all the
time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> And you let me sit there and emote
all over the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Gimme—gimme——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> Oh, I suppose I’ve got to. Oh, I’m
sick of soap anyhow. 13 may be a lucky hunch for
you boys, but it has been a hoodoo for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> And now, my little hearts of lettuce, this
concludes your portion of the evening’s entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Countess.</span> But at that, don’t give me away, will
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I like you, you’ve got brains. Most

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Isn’t it a shame that you can’t get soap

us merely for the use of our trade-mark without

us for the trade-mark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Where’s that—that Mr.——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Mr. Peale—oh, Mr. Peale’s gone back to
the office—but he told me to tell you that he’d got
that contract——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Great, great! He’s a smart boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> We are all smart—it’s a smart firm. We
just got a letter from Macy’s for 10,000 cakes of
13 Soap, and this time you didn’t send a telegram——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Macy’s, eh? Well, well. Now, I’ll
be frank. I want Rodney to come in with me—and
you’ve got to help. You started this scheme. Now
finish it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What’s changed you all of a sudden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Well, Macy’s, for one thing. That
shows sensational advertising does pay. Those boys
are right. I’ve been too conservative, but anyhow
I’ve got the whip hand: Rodney can’t get his soap
for Macy’s except from me, and if I’m going to
furnish three-cent soap that he sells wholesale for
sixty cents, I’m going to be in on the profits. Any
young man who can do that is just bound to have me
for a partner whether he wants me or not. What
do you say, Miss Grayson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I’ll do all I can for Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You have authority to close the deal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Good. Now, what’s your proposition?
(<i>Sits</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Five hundred thousand dollars cash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Rising</i>) What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Calmly</i>) Sit down. That isn’t all: we
get 51% of the stock, you put up a factory and give
Rodney $50,000 a year, Peale, $30,000, and me
$20,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> As my son once observed, what a lovely
autumn we’re having! (<i>He leans back and lights a
cigar. As he does so, <span class="smcap">Mary</span> pushes the buzzer twice.
N. B. The audience must hear this buzzer. Almost
instantly the ’phone rings. <span class="smcap">Mary</span> quickly takes
’phone</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Shall I answer it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Go ahead—say I’m out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>In ’phone</i>) Oh, hello—(<i>To <span class="smcap">Martin</span></i>)
It’s for me. Hello, Rodney—you’ve seen Bronson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Sitting up</i>) Bronson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>In ’phone</i>) He did? Why, that’s a
splendid offer. I hardly dared think Marshall Field
would be so generous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>Promptly. Rises</i>) I’ll accept your
proposition, Miss Grayson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Wait. (<i>In ’phone</i>) Have you closed
with Bronson yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What’d he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, you haven’t?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No, I think you’d better come right up
from the office and see me before you sign anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Here, let me talk to him. (<i>He reaches
for ’phone</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Quickly</i>) Oh, hello, hello. (<i>She jiggles
’phone</i>) Oh, dear, we’ve been cut off. Still, it
doesn’t matter; it’s all settled now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> That’s splendid, Miss Grayson. I’m
mighty grateful to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Nervously</i>) Shall we sign a memorandum
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Sure—sure—just the rough details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Sure, never put off till to-morrow what
you can sign to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>He crosses to table <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, sits and makes
memoranda. Writing</i>) Fifty-one per cent—Rodney—fifty
thousand. And what’s that young
man’s name again—Spiel——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Peale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> That certainly is one hell of a name—thirty
thousand—Grayson twenty thousand. There.
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>) You sign here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No, you sign first. (<i><span class="smcap">Martin</span> grunts and
signs</i>) Now I’ll sign for Rodney. (<i>She does so
gleefully</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> That’s great. (<i>Rises and goes <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You don’t know how great it is. (<i><span class="smcap">Mary</span>
starts for door</i>) Now, I’ve a big surprise for you.
Rodney’s not at the office—he’s in there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Only that I thought I’d handle you less
sentimentally than he would. You see, once before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
I spoiled Rodney’s plan. This time I thought I
ought to fix it up for him. (<i>Opening door</i>) Rodney—Ambrose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Say, what is all this?</p>

<p class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Rodney</span> and <span class="smcap">Peale</span> enter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Hello, father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Rodney, it’s all settled. Your father has
gone in with us. I’ve the contract.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Then we can get some soap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> All you want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Then I don’t care what the arrangement
is—now that we can make good—twenty per
cent of the profits, and any old salary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Twenty per cent! Why, she buncoed
me out of fifty-one per cent and half a million down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> (<i>Gasping</i>) Half a million!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>) You did? Mary, you are
a peach!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) And by the terms of my
contract with you, you now owe me 10% of what
Rodney has made: $50,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> What contract?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I don’t get you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> So that’s why you held me up, eh?
Just to get your 10%. Say, young lady, I’ve got a
lot of other money that you are overlooking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Father, what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) I’ll tell you what I
mean. She got engaged to you to make you go to
work—she only left me to keep you on the job
because I promised her 10% of what you earned.
All the time that she’s been pretending she would
marry you, she’s been making use of you. (<i>Goes to
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span> of table to sign check</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Mary, you did this to me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I don’t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Martin</span></i>) You owe me fifty thousand
dollars—can I have the check, please?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes, if you’ll quit now—get out of
here for good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> I’m disappointed to think you’d treat
my boy like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What’s the difference? If I’d really
loved him, you’d have objected to his marrying only
a typewriter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Objected! If you’d been on the level
I’d have been proud to have you for my daughter.
(<i>Handing check to <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>Gleefully</i>) Hurrah, Mary, it’s all
right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> I don’t get you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> What is this—a joke? (<i>Rises</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Certainly it is: you two put up a joke
on me, and Mary and I thought we’d put up one for
you. Mary told me about that fool contract weeks
ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You mean you’re going to marry her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Now see here——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Why aren’t you going to marry her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> Because we were married this morning,
and we thought before we told you of our marriage
we’d get her percentage for a wedding present.
(<i>Hands check to <span class="smcap">Peale</span>. He gives it to <span class="smcap">Mary</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And it’s bigger than we ever hoped for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> By George, you boys were right: I am
an old fool. Anyhow, I’ll win that bet from old
John Clark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And now for Bronson. (<i>Goes to door <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>
lower</i>) Oh, Mr. Bronson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> You boys know Bronson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, yes, we had a long talk, with him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
right in this room, about a proposition from Marshall
Field——</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Bronson</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> (<i>Crosses to <span class="smcap">Martin, Sr.</span></i>) Mr.
Martin—Mr. Peale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rodney.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Bronson</span></i>) Now you talk to
father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes, you talk to him, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peale.</span> Yes, father, you talk to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Rodney</span></i>) But I thought I was
dealing with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> No, sir, with me—now what’s your
proposition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bronson.</span> A quarter of a million cash just for
the trade-mark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> A quarter of a million? Why, you
ought to be ashamed of yourself to try to trim these
poor boys like that. You know that 13 Soap is
worth half a million in Chicago alone, and you try
to take advantage of these kids’ ignorance. Why,
it’s outrageous, but you can’t trim me! No, sir,
we wouldn’t take a million. Do you know that the
Uneeda trade-mark is valued at six million, the
Gold Dust Twins at ten million and our trade-mark
is better than theirs! We’re going to advertise all
over the world. That’s what advertising means:
the power of suggestion—the psychology of print.
All you have to do is to say a thing often enough
and hard enough, and ninety-seven per cent of the
public’ll fall. Say, what kind of garters do you
wear? Boston! Why? Because all your life every
time you opened a magazine you saw a picture of a
man’s leg with a certain kind of a garter on it—Boston!</p>
